Unity's build in IK system was insanely easy to set up using their documentation. And as it's built in it means we aren't
dependent on another third party asset. All I had to do was check a simple checkmark and write a super simple script
"IKController".

Issue to fix: having the animated version have physics as well

The feet were moving with the animation and not planted if I made them just follow the hips or legs. So I had to adjust the
IKController to be split up into multiple different states depending on the animation.

The hands are gonna be much harder to match with the ground though, as they don't stay on the ground like the feet.

I've got a weird issue where the character keeps moving from place to place when changing animations.


So I tried using IK for the hands to match them with the ground, but it's got its downsides. It does match with the ground well,
but because of the way it works it will try to stay on the ground for too long, making them kind of act unnaturally and
try pointing down to the ground for too long
