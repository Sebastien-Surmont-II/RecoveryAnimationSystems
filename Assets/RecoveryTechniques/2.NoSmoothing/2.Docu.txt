This part fixes 2 things, the ragdoll will stand up where it landed instead of snapping back to where the logic transform is & it plays a standing up animation before standing up. (first it smoothly rotates the bones to the beginning of the
animation's bone rotations)

Positives & Negatives:
++ Doesn't take long to set up & is consistent, can be as fast as you want
++ Pretty believable when getting up on a flat floor with no height differences
& no external factors
-- As soon as you're on a slope or some kind of height difference it will
look very unrealistic
-- Doesn't interact with anything while it's getting up
-- The bones can rotate in unnatural ways when smoothly rotating to the beginning
of the animation
